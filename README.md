# Auto-Car-Sales-Demand-Prices-and-Income-A-Statistical-Study-Using-Functional-Data-Analysis-and-Tim
The Analysis is performed using Stata
I have worked on this project together with my colleague. We have collected the data from various repositories.
The main idea of the project is as follows.
The automobile industry has a fundamental impact on the economic activity in United States and world. The global automotive industry is estimated to grow just under 9 trillion dollars by 2030 and new vehicle sales will account for 38% of this value. Acknowledging the fact that US automotive market is one of the largest, in this paper we will explore the US market characteristics focusing on the demand with other explanatory variables. 
Previous studies had been conducted using the different models and variables, however some of them used non recent time periods. The purpose of this study is to investigate key aspects of the US automobile market and give a pretext for more exhaustive studies of recent issues. Our main objective is to understand the relationship between the prices and the disposable income. This is done using monthly data from 2005 to 2020 and developing a time series Vector Error Correction Model. 
The paper is organized as follows â€“ 1) Exploration of Variables 2) Estimation of Model and Price Elasticities 3) Describing general market landscape and its main issues and concerns.
In our study we have used lagged explanatory variables to understand the long run relationship and from our study we found that the Average auto price is not an important factor for the shift in the demand function (as many previous studies depict) and the disposable income is proportionally related to the demand.
From our model in the long run, price elasticity is inelastic that means the reaction of the demand is relatively unresponsive to the changes in price.
Our main premise was that the price grow rate is greater than the disposable income grow rate, and this would lead to decrease in the demand. Even if the price is not significant in our model so further research should be conducted in order to understand this relationship better and investigate the role of interest rates and loans.
